This is an FAQ for undergraduate students in my English 230 course, "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (Fall 2020), at the University of Victoria. I'll circulate the complete course outline in September. Thank you for your patience.  

## What Will We Study? 

We'll examine the role of media in contemporary fiction. This means we'll talk a lot about audio, image, and text: how we read works of fiction but also play, watch, and listen to them. 

Here's a list of works we'll study in the course:

* The graphic novel and memoir, [*Fun Home*](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/), by Alison Bechdel 
* The speculative fiction, ["Message in a Bottle"](https://tachyonpublications.com/product/falling-love-hominids/), by Nalo Hopkinson 
* Experimental fiction such as [*With Those We Love Alive*](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive), by Porpentine and Brenda Neotenomie, and [*THE M00D OF THE MOMENT*](https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html) by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries
* The animated short film, [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWjnYKyiUB8), by Amanda Strong and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson 
* The role-playing game, [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/), by Toby Fox and Temmie Chang
* The platforming game, [*Celeste*](http://www.celestegame.com/), by Extremely Ok
* The first-person game, [*Gone Home*](https://gonehome.game/), by the Fulbright Company 
* The dramatic podcast, [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires), by Jeffrey Cranor, Janina Matthewson, and Mary Epworth 

I'm asking you to purchase only *one* of these works: Bechdel's *Fun Home*. I'm also providing you with a free textbook on contemporary media and fiction.

## What Will We Learn? 

In "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (English 230),  you'll learn to: 

* Interpret audio, image, and text in the context of contemporary fiction. We'll practice various techniques for listening, watching, reading, and playing media, and you'll develop a vocabulary for talking about media and fiction together.  
* Communicate critically with audio, image, and text. You'll have opportunities to practice with each of these media. I will assume you have no previous experience with producing them. 
* Use media as forms of evidence in arguments and criticism. You'll learn to integrate audio, images, and even video alongside quotations. 
* Make a simple website, compose some content for it, and publish it using your UVic webspace. No worries if you've never made your own site. I'll provide you with examples and templates, which you can copy, paste, and edit. I will assume no experience in web design or content management. I will not ask you to purchase any software, and I'll provide you with instructions for passcode-protecting the websites you make. 

All four of these outcomes should apply to work across disciplines and occupations, regardless of your major at UVic. They are all incredibly useful, in and beyond the academy, when writing with or about media for the web.

## What Are the Assignments? 

I'm asking you to: 

* Create and maintain a simple research blog, which I'll mark three times during the term (each of these three marks will be 25% of your final grade) 
* Complete a series of online workshops with your peers (15% of your mark)
* Participate in online discussion forums with your peers (10% of your mark)

There are no essays or presentations required for this course. There is no exam, either. 

## What Do I Need to Purchase? 

The textbook for "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (English 230) is available online for free. I wrote it with teaching and learning at UVic in mind, meaning it's intended primarily for UVic students. Each chapter is available in audio and text formats for listening and/or reading. 

The only text I'm asking you to purchase is a copy of Bechdel's *Fun Home* (print or ebook), which will be available at the UVic Bookstore. A new copy should cost you no more than $26.00. 

I'll provide you with a course packet, too, and point you to various materials published online. I will recommend some games and books that you can purchase, if you wish.

You do not need to purchase any software for this course; however, you'll need access to the internet and a computer. 

## When Will We Meet, and How Is the Course Structured? 

We'll have one Zoom meeting each week: *Tuesdays, from 10:30 to 11:20am.* Weekly Zoom meetings will be dedicated to discussion, not lecture. I will also occasionally treat them as opportunities to clarify materials in the textbook and to address your questions. You will be welcome to participate via chat, audio, or video. These Zoom meetings will be recorded in case you're unable to attend them.  

Aside from weekly Zoom meetings, I will hold two optional office hours each week (date and time to be determined). They will be open to everyone in the course, and I will use Zoom for those as well.  

All other aspects of "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (English 230) will unfold asynchronously. I'll ask you to study (read, watch, listen, or play) a work every week or two. The course textbook, much like a lecture, will provide you with terminology and explain approaches to these works. It will also include prompts for your blog. Chapters in the textbook are available in text and audio formats, meaning you can read and/or listen to them.  

## How Will We Study Games? What If I Don't Play Them?  
I've selected three indie games for us to interpret and discuss. They are available across platforms, including Itch, which is DRM-free. If you'd rather not purchase or play them, then you're welcome watch no-commentary gameplay videos of them. 

You'll access other formats (including podcasts, animations, and experimental fiction) online, and you can read *Fun Home* in print or with an e-reader.

I'll include samples of assigned works in our weekly Zoom meetings. This way, we can read, watch, play, and listen to parts of them in the same space (while abiding by copyright and fair dealing guidelines).  

## Will You Circulate a Technology Survey? 

At the beginning of the term, I will send you a brief survey, which should take you no more than ten minutes to complete. You can respond to it to tell me about how you'll be accessing Zoom meetings and course materials, including any technologies you'll be using during the term. You can also respond to it to let me know other things you think I should consider before proceeding with "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (English 230). 

## Where Can I Learn More? 

The Department of English published this [description](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/assets/docs/Course%20Descriptions/230-sayers--fall-2020.pdf) of "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (English 230) earlier this year. Please note some changes: for example, we are now meeting only on Tuesdays, and there is no exam. 

Here's a poster for the course:
